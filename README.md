# Dental Fear and Anxiety (DFA) NLP

Natural language processing methods used for the dental fear and anxiety project.

## Motivation

The Dental Fear & Anxiety (DFA) project aims to support research on psychological, behavioral, and experiential factors related to dental fear and anxiety. 
Our goal of DFA-NLP is to apply natural language processing and machine learning methods to reduce the manual effort needed for information acquisition and streamline the ontology-building process.

## Projects

This repository contains a Python application that supports the DFA project by automatically retrieving, organizing, and analyzing scientific literature.

### Topic Modeling Variants DFA Scientific Literature 

The following topic-modeling approaches are applied to the DFA scientific literature: 
- NMF (TF–IDF) for transparent lexical topics, 
- Anchored CorEx for seed-guided thematic steering, and 
- BERTopic for embedding-based semantic clustering.
